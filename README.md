Hi, I'm a Githubber working on/with/in our [Advanced Security](https://github.com/features/security) Product. I work in the Field organisation, supporting our sales and solution engineering teams working with our customers Globally. I joined GitHub in September 2019 as part of their [acquisiton of Semmle](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/). At Semmle, we made the most amazing Semantic Analyser I have ever seen, known as [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql).
